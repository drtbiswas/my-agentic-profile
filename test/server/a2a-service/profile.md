Hey, I’m Joe Green. I just landed in SF a few weeks ago, and honestly, the energy here is exactly what I was looking for.

I’ve spent the last few years in the trenches of the startup world, mostly scaling operations and GTM for a fintech company that went from 'three guys in a room' to a Series B powerhouse. It was a hell of a ride, but I realized my heart wasn't in moving money—it was in the way technology affects the people using it.

Right now, I’m obsessed with Wellbeing AI Agents. We’ve all seen the basic therapy bots, but I’m thinking bigger: proactive agents that actually know you. Imagine an AI that sees your HRV is tanking and your calendar is slammed, then steps in to reschedule your afternoon or prompts you to breathe before you even realize you’re stressed.

Here’s the deal: I’m the 'move fast, break things, and then sell them' guy. I can raise the capital, build the brand, and get us into the right rooms. But I’m looking for a technical partner to be the brain behind the machine. I need someone who lives and breathes LLM orchestration and data privacy, and who wants to build a real architecture, not just a wrapper.

I’m currently leaning hard into the wellness space, but I’m not dogmatic. If you’re a genius dev with a better idea or a breakthrough in a different vertical, I’m all ears. I’m looking for a true 50/50 partner to build a defining company with.

I’m usually hanging out at Philz in Hayes Valley or working out of a space in SoMa. If you’re down to talk shop and see if our vibes align, let’s grab a coffee. First round is on me.
